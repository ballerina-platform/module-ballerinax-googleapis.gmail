## 1. Overview

The Ballerina language offers first-class support for writing network-oriented programs. The `gmail` package leverages these language features to create a programming model for consuming the Gmail REST API.

It offers intuitive resource methods to interact with the [Gmail API v1](https://gmail.googleapis.com/$discovery/rest?version=v1).

## 2. Client

This section outlines the client of the Ballerina `gmail` package. To utilize the Ballerina `gmail` package, a user must first import it.

### Example: Importing the Gmail package

```ballerina
import ballerinax/googleapis.gmail;
```

The `gmail:Client` allows you to connect to the Gmail RESTful API. The client currently supports the processing of the `Profile`, `Message`, `Draft`, `Thread`, and `Label` resources. The client employs HTTP as the underlying protocol for communication with the API.

### 2.1 Initializing the client

The `gmail:Client` initialization method requires valid authentication credentials.

```ballerina
gmail:Client gmail = check new gmail:Client (
    config = {
        auth: {
            refreshToken,
            clientId,
            clientSecret
        }
    }
);
```

The `gmail:Client` uses an `http:Client` as its underlying implementation. You can configure this `http:Client` by providing the `gmail:ConnectionConfig` as a parameter during the `gmail:Client` initialization.

## 3. `Profile` resource

You can retrieve the details of the authenticated user using the `/users/[userId]/profile()` resource method. The `Profile` record includes the following fields:

```ballerina
public type Profile record {
    string emailAddress?;
    string historyId?;
    int:Signed32 messagesTotal?;
    int:Signed32 threadsTotal?;
};
```

### Example: Retrieving the Gmail profile

```ballerina
Profile profile = check gmail->/users/me/profile();
```

In this example, the `getProfile` method retrieves the profile of the authenticated user. The `me` parameter represents the authenticated user.

## 4. `Message` Resource

The `Message` resource represents an email message, encompassing the sender, recipients, subject, and body. Once a message is created, its content cannot be modified.

This resource provides various methods for accessing and manipulating email messages:

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `/users/[userId]/messages()` | Lists all the messages in the user's mailbox. |
| `/users/[userId]/messages.post()` | Directly inserts a message into the user's mailbox similar to `IMAP APPEND`. This bypasses most of the scanning and classification processes. Note that this does not send the message. |
| `/users/[userId]/messages/batchDelete.post()` | Deletes multiple messages using their message IDs. |
| `/users/[userId]/messages/batchModify.post()` | Modifies the labels of the specified messages. |
| `/users/[userId]/messages/import.post()` | Imports a message into the user's mailbox with standard email delivery scanning and classification, similar to receiving via SMTP. Note that this method does not perform SPF checks and does not send the message. |
| `/users/[userId]/messages/send.post()` | Sends the specified message to the recipients with the `To`, `Cc`, and `Bcc` headers. |
| `/users/[userId]/messages/[messageId]()` | Retrieves the specified message. |
| `/users/[userId]/messages/[messageId].delete()` | Permanently deletes the specified message immediately. |
| `/users/[userId]/messages/[messageId]/modify.post()` | Modifies the labels of the specified message. |
| `/users/[userId]/messages/[messageId]/trash.post()` | Moves the specified message to the trash. |
| `/users/[userId]/messages/[messageId]/untrash.post()` | Removes the specified message from the trash. |
| `/users/[userId]/messages/[messageId]/attachments/[attachmentId]()` | Retrieves the attachment of the specified message. |

## 5. `Draft` Resource

A `Draft` in the context of the Gmail API represents an unsent message. The content of a draft can be replaced, and when you decide to send a draft, it automatically deletes the draft itself and generates a message with the `SENT` system label.

This resource provides several methods for accessing and manipulating drafts:
| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `users/[userId]/drafts()` | Lists all the drafts in the user's mailbox. |
| `users/[userId]/drafts.post()` | Creates a new draft with the `DRAFT` system label. |
| `users/[userId]/drafts/send.post()` | Sends the specified draft to the recipients with the `To`, `Cc`, and `Bcc` headers. This action deletes the draft and creates a message with the `SENT` system label. |
| `users/[userId]/drafts/[draftId]()` | Retrieves the specified draft. |
| `users/[userId]/drafts/[draftId].put()` | Replaces the content of the specified draft. |
| `users/[userId]/drafts/[draftId].delete()` | Permanently deletes the specified draft immediately. This action does not move the draft to the trash. |

## 6. `MailThread` Resource

A `MailThread` in the context of the Gmail API represents a conversation, serving as a collection of related messages. In an email client application, a thread is formed when one or more recipients respond to a message with their own replies.

This resource provides various methods for accessing and manipulating email threads:

| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `users/[userId]/threads()` | Lists all the threads in the user's mailbox. |
| `users/[userId]/threads/[threadId]()` | Retrieves the specified thread. |
| `users/[userId]/threads/[threadId].delete()` | Permanently deletes the specified thread including all messages within the thread. This operation cannot be undone. Consider using `threads.trash` instead. |
| `users/[userId]/threads/[threadId].modify()` | Modifies the labels applied to the thread. This affects all the messages in the thread. |
| `users/[userId]/threads/[threadId]/trash.post()` | Moves the specified thread to the trash including all messages within the thread. |
| `users/[userId]/threads/[threadId]/untrash.post()` | Removes the specified thread from the trash including all messages within the thread. |

## 7. `Label` Resource

Labels within the Gmail API serve as a mechanism for categorizing and organizing both messages and threads. For example, you might create a label named `taxes` and apply it to all the messages and threads related to your taxes. There are two primary types of labels:

1. **System labels**: These are internally-created labels, including `INBOX`, `TRASH`, or `SPAM`. System labels cannot be deleted or modified. However, certain system labels, such as `INBOX`, can be applied to or removed from messages and threads.

2. **User labels**: User labels are labels created by a user. These labels are subject to deletion or modification by the user or an application. A user label is represented by a label resource.

This resource provides various methods for accessing and manipulating labels:
| Method | Description |
|---|---|
| `users/[userId]/labels()` | Lists all the labels in the user's mailbox. |
| `users/[userId]/labels.post()` | Creates a new label. |
| `users/[userId]/labels/[labelId]()` | Retrieves the specified label. |
| `users/[userId]/labels/[labelId].put()` | Updates the specified label. |
| `users/[userId]/labels/[labelId].delete()` | Permanently deletes the specified label and removes it from any messages and threads that it is applied to. |
| `users/[userId]/labels/[labelId].patch()` | Partially updates the specified label. Only the fields specified in the request are changed. |

## 8. `History` Resource

The `History` resource provides a means to track all changes made to a specific mailbox within the Gmail API. To access a list of these changes, you can use the `/users/[userId]/history()` method. The results are returned in chronological order, with the `historyId` increasing over time. This chronological ordering facilitates the tracking of the sequence of events and changes made to the mailbox.

## 9. Errors

The `gmail` package includes the following error types:

```bash
.
└── Error                               # Defines the generic error type for the `gmail` module. 
    ├── FileGenericError                # Error that occurs when there is an issue with inline images or attachments. 
                                        # This could be due to issues like file not found, unsupported file type, etc.
    └── ValueEncodeError               # Error that occurs when an invalid encoded value is provided for the `data` fields.
```
